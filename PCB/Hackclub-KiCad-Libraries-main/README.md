# Hackclub KiCad Libraries

This is an enumeration of all the symbols and footprints you'll need to complete all the HackClub guides! If you found a library/symbol not included, feel free to PR it in :D

## Setup

It's really easy to setup these libraries for KiCad! The first thing you're going to do is clone the repository to a known location on your computer. If you have git installed you can do:

```
git clone https://github.com/KaiPereira/Hackclub-KiCad-Libraries.git
```

Or you can also download the repository by tapping the `big blue code button -> download zip`! 

The next thing you're going to do is open KiCad, and then tap on `preferences -> manage symbol libraries`

Then, you're going to tap on the folder button, and then open `Hackclub Symbols.kicad_sym` in your file finder

Now just tap OK and your symbols are good to go! 

Next, we're going to add the footprint library to KiCad! Go back to the KiCad menu and tap on `preferences -> manage footprint libraries`

Now do the same thing, tap on the folder icon, but this time, you're going to select the whole `Hackclub Footprints.pretty` _folder_ and add that in!

Now you're good to go with following any of the HackClub tutorials! If you need any, feel free to ask on Slack in #electronics or any other related hardware channel!
